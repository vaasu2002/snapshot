## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start
First, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Version `16.0.0` (or higher) is required.

You can use **Snapshot** directly without installation by running the following command to initialize a new configuration:

```console
npx snapshot init
```

This command will create a `snapshot` folder in your current directory, containing a `config.json` file. Open the `config.json` file and add the required configuration details, such as database connection URLs, backup type, storage options, and scheduling preferences.

Alternatively, you can install **Snapshot** globally for repeated use:

```console
npm install -g snapshot
```

Once your configuration is set up, import the **Snapshot** library into your application and start the backup process with:

```javascript
const snapshot = require('snapshot');

snapshot.start();
```

This will begin the backup process based on the settings defined in your `config.json`.

That's it! üéâ **Snapshot** is now actively managing your database backups and ensuring your data is secure.
